MEMR.DOC - INFORMATION ABOUT THIS MEMORY TEST

	The MEMR Rasmussen memory test has been developed at
Lifeboat Associates so that our customers may easily
check their memory system. We recommend frequent testing of
new memory boards until they are burned in, which takes a
couple of months, and occasional checkups after that.

	The program performs a battery of tests to test
memory under a variety of conditions.  If a test fails 
in any given memory location, that location will be displayed
on the console along with the byte that should have been
in memory and the actual value in both HEX and binary bits.
This may be a further aid to find out what is wrong.
If multiple errors are reported, the test will display a screen
full of error reports, one to a line, and then wait for
you to press a key to continue.  Until the screen if full of
error reports, the test will continuously cycle.

	There is one test that MEMR can't do however, and that
is performance under daily use.  If you seem to have unexplained
problems with your computer such as program crashing, try
this test.  It may detect a memory problem which can then be
dealt with, and if not, proably eliminates memory as a source.

	This memory test will use default addresses if
the starting and ending address questions are answered with a "CR".
It can be interrupted by pressing the console ESC (escape) key.

	The forms of the test are:
	MEMR		Gives complete battery of tests
	MEMR T		Above plus display of memory top
			and quick complement test of all RAM.
	MEMR R		Random number test only.
	MEMR M		M1 cycle test only displays each address

	Eg. Type "MEMR T" followed by carrige return for random test.

	This test is designed to display the most common
problems first and most uncommon ones last.
For example, you may test for gross defects by simply
typing "MEMR T" which will start out with the quick test
of all memory.  
The test will continue over and over until the you terminate
by pressing the ESC key.

Generally memory chip failures will be found within 5 seconds.
The test takes several minutes to run all phases in a 32k board.

	To completely test for all address open and short
combinations, the test should be run over a 4K boundry.
Then run the test over the full range. There are some
subtle things that get missed if you only run the
test over the full range and not 4K at a time.

If the memory board passes these tests and will
run for an hour on the random numbers test
without a problem, look elsewhere for your troubles.


The following tests are performed and explained in detail below:

	1. Fast complement test of all memory.
	2. Bit stuck high or low test.
	3. Adjacent bits shorted test.
	4. Checkboard pattern test.
	5. Walking bit left test.
	6. Walking bit right test.
	7. Address line test.
	8. Random number test.
	9. M1 cycle test.

FAST COMPLEMENT TEST:
This is a test of ALL MEMORY starting at 0 to top of RAM.
It loads each byte and tries to store the complement.
Tests if properly complemented and restores original byte.
This is the only test that can test where MEMR runs
in the TPA (from 0 to approx 800H) and the BIOS area
which contains the console drivers.

BIT STUCK TEST:
1. Fills test area with 0FFH and checks for 0FFH.
2. Then fills test area with 0's and tests for 0's.
3. Then re-fills with 0FFH and tests
   just in case the bit was originally high in (1.).

ADJACENT BIT SHORTED TEST:
Sets a single bit in all bytes high.
Then checks if a bit is shorted to the
ones on each side.
The test repeats 8 times, rotating
the test bit from LSB to MSB.

CHECKERBOARD TEST:
Fill memory with 0AAH, 55H pattern and check.
This forms an alternating "checkerboard".
Then reverse the pattern and re-check.

WALKING BIT TEST:
Fill memory with one bit set for each byte.
The bit rotates at memory increases.
For example, byte 1 has bit 1 set, byte 2 bit 2 etc.
Then memory is checked for the proper pattern.
This is repeated 8 times, rotating the bit each time.
Then, the whole procedure is repeated rotating
the opposite way.
This is a very severe test that frequently detects
errors that other tests in the battery do not.
Don't be surprised if the walking bit "right" test
detects errors that "left" doesn't, or vice versa.
Sometimes memory developes strange pattern sensitive
errors that are most difficult to find.

ADDRESS LINE SHORTED TEST:
This test will detect addressing problems in memory boards.
It fills all memory with 55H, then writes an 0AAH
at the lowest memory location tested.
It then rechecks the rest of memory to see if it is still 55H.
It then clears the original location of AAH and writes
writes the AAH into the next location.
Then does same with location 2,4,8,etc setting
a new address bit high each time and testing all of memory.
If any address bit is shorted to another,
the test will find an 0AAH in another location
than the place it wrote one.

RANDOM NUMBER TEST:
A random number routine generates an 8 bit number
pattern and writes it through all test memory.
It then re-inserts the same seed to the routine
and test reads the memory. A new seed is generated
and the exercise is repeated with a new pattern.
This test goes thru 8 cycles each time the battery
is run.  If "MEMR R" is used, it cycles continuously
until terminated with an ESC.

M1 CYCLE TEST
This tests the M1 cycle time for executing instructions
which is different than the time to simply read memory
in the Z-80.  The times are the same in 8080 so the
test is not especially useful for them.
A small segment of executing code "worms" its way thru
memory, reporting the results of its execution at each
memory location.  Marginal memory may pass all the other
tests but fail to execute properly at a given address.
When this happens, the test normally reports the error
location in the standard way.  However, the faulty execution
may cause the test to "bomb" at this point.

By running the M1 test in the form "MEMR M", only this
test will run, reporting each address as it executes.
If a memory failure causes the test to bomb, the last 
address displayed on the screen locates the failure address.

Please note that the M1 test (only) uses restart locations
2 and 5 in its operation, and also inserts an error trap
at restart location 7, which is the most likely landing
place for a program gone wild.  That is, a program gone
haywire, jumping randomly all over memory, is likely at some
point to land in a location that has no memory which will
appear to contain the instruction 0FFH, which is a restart 7,
which causes the CPU to immediately jump to 38H, the restart
7 location. We mention this because, it your computer happens
to use restarts 2, 5 or 7 for critical operations, this test
may not run.  That's why it is last.

CUSTOMIZATION NOTES:

	This test is designed to use the CP/M BIOS console
input/output drivers.  This means that the BIOS area itself
may not be tested.  If you have a prom monitor or wish to
write your own I/O routines, this test may be modified to
use them.

	You will find a jump table at the start of MEMR
which contains jumps to routines that perform the functions
of return to monitor, console status, input and output.
The console routines use the CP/M conventions.  That is
for example, console output is considered to be from the
C register, etc. The portion of the table that may be
patched is as follows.

	ORG	100H		BEGINNING OF TPA
	JMP	START		STARTS MEMR, DONT CHANGE THIS ONE.
	JMP	CINIT		INITIALIZE CONSOLE OR WHATEVER.
	JMP	MONITOR		CONTROL C EXIT COMES HERE.
	JMP	CONST		CONSOLE STATUS 0FFH=READY, 0=NOT.
	JMP	CONIN		CONSOLE INPUT TO A.
	JMP	CONOUT		CONSOLE OUTPUT FROM C.
	DW	TFIRST		FIRST BYTE TESTED.

	If you wish to simply add on your I/O routines
to the end of this program, start your patches at TFIRST
and modify TFIRST to be wherever your patches end.
This will change the default starting address so MEMR doesn't
scramble your routines. MONITOR is normally a CP/M warm boot
but could be a jump to your monitor, cold boot, etc.


FINAL AUTHORS NOTE

	Good luck with your use of Lifeboat's memory test.
If you find any strange bugs or think of other tests that
might be usefully added to the battery, please contact me.
